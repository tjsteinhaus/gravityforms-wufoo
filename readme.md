Connects Gravity Forms and Wufoo together
 
== Description ==
 
Wufoo only has a couple options to embed their forms on your website and all of them are sloppy. Gravity Forms + Wufoo allows you to still use Wufoo but allows you to embed your form on your website by using the power of Gravity Forms.

You may ask why would I use both Wufoo and Gravity Forms when the form fields are exactly the same, and to that I say some clients want to stick with Wufoo and don't want to make the transition to a new form software. This allows you to create  the forms on a website but in a format that's easy to work with.
